Within the Jupyter_Fabric_Testbed_Infrastructure directory, one can find infrastructure code (python for Fabric and bash for incus infrastructure ) that allow me to create layer 2 and 3 topologies to gather data for the multi-layer perceptron that I developed for this project.<br />
Within the Telemetry_Data_Gatherer directory, one can find my code for capturing network packets, parsing packets, cleaning data, generating summary statistics, and create a machine learning neural network multi-layer perceptron.
